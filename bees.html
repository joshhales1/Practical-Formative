All around the page looks uninteresting to much extent. There are no designs. However the tag usage are consistent.

    <hr class="m-4"/>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Why bees?</h2>
    <img src="images/bee-on-flower.jpg" alt="A bee on a yellow flower" width="400" class="float-right"/>
    <p>Bees are an essential part of the ecosystem. Without them, it wouldn't be long before our ecosystem collapsed</p>
    <p>
        This is because bees pollinate our wild trees and flowers, which other insects rely on. These insects need to survive to support birds, bats,
        mammals and every subsequent creature in the food chain!
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Why are bees in danger?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Noah Wilson-Rich</b>, chief scientific officer of US firm <em>The Best Bees Company</em>, says that it's worrying
        how many American honey bee colonies die every year.
    </p>
    <p>
        A 
        <a href="https://beeinformed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BIP_2019_2020_Losses_Abstract.pdf">survey</a> 
        showed that between April 2019 and 2020,
        <b>43.7%</b> of US hives were lost. This is a shocking
        figure, and it <i>"just shows how messed up things are currently"</i>, says Mr Wilson-Rich.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How are we helping?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://bestbees.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">The Best Bees Company</a> helps by installing hives on roofs and in gardens.
        Staff members use an advanced software system to monitor the health of the colonies, and share the collected data 
    with Havard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) so that researchers can make predictions
    and analyse what helps to make a colony of bees thrive.</p>
    <p><i>"We are looking at why thriving beehives live"</i></p>

    <div>
        <i>
            "We need to understand why they're doing better.
            With that research data we can get wonderful benefits... it is telling us how the bees are actually doing."
        </i>
        <p>~ Mr Wilson-Rich</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How does this system work?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            <i>"We collect temperature, humidity, sound and acceleration [of the bees flying out of the hive] data,"</i>
            says chief executive Fiona Edwards Murphy. <i>
                "What we do is extract those raw data points and then use
                <em>machine learning</em> to convert that into useful information. We tell the beekeeper, for example,
                which hives are growing and which hives are shrinking, or which hives are alive and which hives are dead."
            </i>
            This information helps save time and money, allowing beekeepers to target their attention on the hives that are
            struggling, rather than picking at random.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Are there any other similar bee-helping systems?</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Beewise</em>, a firm based in Israel takes this even further. Their <cite>"Beehome"</cite> is a large
        solar-powered box-shaped structure that can house <b>24</b> separate hives! Each home comes with cameras, sensors, and
        even robotic arms to carry out actions a human would normally do, reducing the need for human intervention. These jobs include:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
            <li>Pest control</li>
            <li>Swarm prevention</li>
            <li>Harvesting honey</li>
        </ul>
        to name a few. These automated functions simplify the beekeeping process, and help us look after our bees.
