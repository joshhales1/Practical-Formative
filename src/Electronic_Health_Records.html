            What is an Electronic Health Record?
        </h2>

            Cost Saving and Efficiency
        </h3>
        <p>
            EHRs have been found by health care providers to improve the operation of medical practice by increasing efficiency as well as cutting unnessessary costs.<br>
            This is done in several ways:<br>
            Reduced transcription costs - As charts pertaining to patients is digitalised, the need for physical transcripts is greatly reduced, saving money on the cost of producing, and safely storing the paper transcripts.<br>
            Reduced costs pertaining to the editing of data - As the patients information is now stored digitally, the cost of editing information is vastly reduced, with paper, the chart would have to be reprinted with the new edit, each time a change was made.<br>
            Improved safety and storage of documents - As the documents as now digitally stored, they can be stored in a more efficient manner, that is more protected against damage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-l font-bold mt-1">
            Improved Coordination of Care
        </h3>
        <p>
            EHRs allow for the instantaneous and secure sharing of medical data with trusted users, across medical facilities.<br>
            This can greatly improve the quality and speed of care administered to patients. Especially when:<br>
            Multiple involved specialists - When the patient is being treated by multiple specialists EHRs allow all of them to view the real time state of the patient and to coordinate their treatment.<br>
            Emergency treatment - In emergency situations the time saved by not having to wait for a physical copy of a patient's details to be transferred, either by fax or other means, can be and often is life saving<br>
            Moving patients - When a patient is moved, their medical information needs to move with them. EHRs allow this process to be near instantaneous, compared to the time taken to transport physical charts.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-l font-bold mt-1">
            Improved Outcomes and Diagnostics
        </h3>
        <p>
            EHRs allow medical specialists to have instant access to real time accurate and complete data regarding a patient. This allows for the patient to recieve more effective and personalised treatment.<br>
            EHRs also improve the reliabilty of diagnoses as they reduce the chance of human error regarding to the inputting of patient data, improve the accessability of patient information and allow for data to reach specialists more quickly.
